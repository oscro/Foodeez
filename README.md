## <a name="dec"></a> Project Description
FoodEEZ is a dynamic website that was built using various front-end and back-end technologies  
We decided to create an interactive restuarant and recipe search website that uses two popular API to get recipes from a remote server and delivers the results in an easy and simple manner.
You can use this website to search for over a million resturants and recipes. Just put in what you want cusine you would like, or even some of the ingredients you have and we'll find a match for you adn simplify your life 😊️
## <a name="tech"></a>What We Used

### Note
Since we are using the _free_ developer version of the [EDAMAM recipe API](https://www.edamam.com/) we are limited to 5 API calls per minute.
So if you encounter any problems while using the site - just give it a minute
### <a name="fDev"></a>Future Development
- Migrate to a different API (better free tier)
- Make the website fully responsive on mobile for a variety of devices and screen sizes
- Add a movie API to integrate our same simplifying methods to choosing a movie
